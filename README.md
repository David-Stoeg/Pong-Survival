\# Pong Survival



In Pong Survival you have to stay alive as long as possible.

Try to beat your personal high scores. If you are content with a score, you can save it to the local leaderboard.



After each game you can take a look at the ball’s full trajectory, adding a unique analytical element to the game.

You may even export your scores, trajectories, and leaderboard to save them on your device and cherish them forever.



Use the arrow keys, mouse/touch controls to move your paddle and see how long you can survive.



Have fun!
